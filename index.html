      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        ðŸ”¹ As the founder of a successful moving company, I scaled operations from the ground upâ€”growing revenue from $0 to over $2.4M, building efficient systems, leading high-performing teams, and delivering exceptional customer service that earned 150+ 5-star Google reviews.

ðŸ”¹ Iâ€™ve also worked extensively with at-risk youth in treatment homes and residential settings, where I provided structure, mentorship, and life skills development. My experience includes planning charitable events that raised over $20,000 for non-profits and coordinating unique community programs with major organizations like the NHL and TSN.

ðŸ”¹ Whether managing logistics in armored transport, coaching group workouts, or supporting legal and administrative processes at the national level, I consistently bring a high level of responsibility, care, and drive to everything I do.

ðŸ”¹ Iâ€™m always open to connecting with like-minded professionals, exploring collaborative opportunities, or sharing insights on operations, leadership, or community impact.
